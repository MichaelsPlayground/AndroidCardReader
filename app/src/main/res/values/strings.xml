            This sample demonstrates how to implement a low-level NFC card reader, for reading cards
            that do not contain NDEF or Android Beam data. This sample is designed to read the virtual
            loyalty card implemented in the "CardEmulation" sample.\n\n

            In particular, this sample demonstrates how to disable Android Beam, select which AIDs the
            reader is interested, and establish communication with the card
